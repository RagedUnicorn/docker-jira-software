> A docker base to build a container for JIRA Software based on Alpine Linux

This container is intended to build a base for running JIRA Software.

### Using the image

#### Start container

The container can be easily started with `docker-compose` command.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Once the container is running navigate to http://[dockerhost]:8080 and finish the configuration. When setting up the database make sure to set the hostname of the database according to the value in docker-compose.stack.yml (by default postgresql).

#### Stop container

To stop all services from the docker-compose file

```
docker-compose down
```

### Creating a stack

To create a stack the specific `docker-compose.stack.yml` file can be used. It requires that you already built all the images that are consumed by the stack or that they are available in a reachable docker repository.

```
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

**Note:** You will get a warning that external secrets are not supported by docker-compose if you try to use this file with docker-compose.

#### Join a swarm

```
docker swarm init
```

#### Create secrets

**Note:** In this case secrets for all the used images need to be provided. The JIRA Software container in this case has no passwords by itself but the postgresql container does.

```
echo "app_user" | docker secret create com.ragedunicorn.postgresql.app_user -
echo "app_user_password" | docker secret create com.ragedunicorn.postgresql.app_user_password -
```

#### Deploy stack
```
docker stack deploy --compose-file=docker-compose.stack.yml [stackname]
```

For a production deployment a stack should be deployed.

## Dockery

In the dockery folder are some scripts that help out avoiding retyping long docker commands but are mostly intended for playing around with the container. For production use docker-compose or docker stack should be used.

#### Build image

The build script builds an image with a defined name

```
sh dockery/dbuild.sh
```

#### Run container

Runs the built container. If the container was already run once it will `docker start` the already present container instead of using `docker run`

```
sh dockery/drun.sh
```

#### Attach container

Attaching to the container after it is running

```
sh dockery/dattach.sh
```

#### Stop container

Stopping the running container

```
sh dockery/dstop.sh
```

## Configuration

#### Build Args

The image allows for certain arguments being overridden by build args.

`JIRA_USER, JIRA_GROUP`

They all have a default value and don't have to be overridden. For details see the Dockerfile.

## Healthcheck

The production and the stack image supports a simple healthcheck showing whether the container is healthy or not. This can be configured inside `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose.stack.yml`

## Test

To do basic tests of the structure of the container use the `docker-compose.test.yml` file.

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up`

For more info see [container-test](https://github.com/RagedUnicorn/docker-container-test).

Tests can also be run by category such as command, fileExistence and metadata tests by starting single services in `docker-compose.test.yml`

```
# basic file existence tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-test
# command tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-test-command
# metadata tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-test-metadata
```

The same tests are also available for the `dev-image`

```
# basic file existence tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-dev-test
# command tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-dev-test-command
# metadata tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up container-dev-test-metadata
```

## Development

To debug the container and get more insight into the container use the `docker-compose.dev.yml` configuration.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

By default the launchscript `/docker-entrypoint.sh` will not be used to start JIRA. Instead the container will be setup to keep `stdin_open` open and allocating a pseudo `tty`. This allows for connecting to a shell and work on the container. A shell can be opened inside the container with `docker attach [container-id]`. JIRA itself can be started with `./docker-entrypoint.sh`. This step has to be repeated for the postgresql container.
